# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3-master
Third project for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
- Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
- Build a convolutional neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
- Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
- Test that the model successfully drives around track 1 without leaving the road
- Summarize the results with a written report

Met spec on first submission.

Select quotes from the review:

"Good effort! Congratulations on successfully completing this project! The car drives well... You have done a commendable job using good set of techniques for your model... Keep up the good work!"

"Excellent work..."

"The car is very stable and navigates around drivable portion of the first track flawlessly. Nice job!"
